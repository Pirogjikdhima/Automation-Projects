# Automation-Projects
I have create 2 simple scripts: The first script is quote.py that is used to fetch quotes form the ZenQuotes.io using their API and also form a local file names quotes.txt; The second is a weather.py that fetches weather data using OpenWeather API.

The third is a Whatsapp automating tool that can send messages to users.It utilizes .bat to open the desktop app(I believe it requires administrator access to use in different machines) and uses the PyAutoGui and PyPaperClip to navigate the screen and paste the message. It's a small and fun program that I will try to upgrade further.
